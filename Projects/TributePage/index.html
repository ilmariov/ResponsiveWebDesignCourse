                <h3>Here is a timeline of George's life:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><span class="bold">1943 </span>- Born in Liverpool England.</p></li>
                    <li><p><span class="bold">1958 </span>- Paul Mccartney and John Lennon introduced george to the band "The Quarrymen"</p></li>
                    <li><p><span class="bold">1960 </span>- Harrison's music career was in full swing. Lennon had renamed the band the 
                        Beatles.Before the end of 1962, Harrison and the Beatles recorded a top 20 U.K.</p></li>
                    <li><p><span class="bold">1963 </span>- From the start, the Beatles were a Lennon-McCartney driven band and brand. 
                        But while the two took up much of the group's songwriting responsibilities, Harrison had shown an early interest 
                        in contributing his own work. In the summer of 1963 he spearheaded his first song, "Don't Bother Me,"</p></li>
                    <li><p><span class="bold">1968 </span>- George's interest in Indian music leads to the Beatles' famous entanglement 
                        with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. By 1968, the Beatles were drifting apart. Both Lennon and McCartney antagonise Harrison 
                        who walks off the set of the film Let it Be after an argument</p></li>
                    <li><p><span class="bold">1970 </span>- Harrison is the first Beatle to start a successful solo career, selling 3m copies 
                        worldwide with his first album, All Things Must Pass</p></li>
                    <li><p><span class="bold">1973 </span>- Releases the hit solo album Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)</p></li>
                    <li><p><span class="bold">1979 </span>- George focuses on a new career as a film producer, and forms the company Handmade 
                        Films with Dennis O'Brien</p></li>
                    <li><p><span class="bold">1980 </span>- Lennon's death inspires Harrison to write the tribute song All Those Years Ago</p></li>
                    <li><p><span class="bold">1987 </span>- Harrison also put together a new rock group, the Travelling Wilburys, with Bob Dylan, 
                        Jeff Lyne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty</p></li>

                </ul>
                <p>“I think that 'Within You Without You' is one of George's best songs, one of my favorites of his. I like the arrangement, the sound, 
                    and the words. He is clear on that song. You can hear his mind is clear and his music is clear. It's his innate talent that comes 
                    through on that song, that brought that song together.”</p>
                <p class="bold">--- John Lennon</p>
